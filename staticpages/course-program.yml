      # Course program

      ## Objectives
      The course aims to provide knowledge and skills on the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for the Automotive. It provides an initial overview, also of an economic impact type, on AI systems that are used in automotive, both for ADAS, for autonomous driving, for human-vehicle interaction and for industrial production. The course offers a detailed overview of the state of the art of AI technologies and above all of deep learning, oriented to visual understanding, action and interaction in the Automotive field, and provides advanced skills on the design of Deep Learning algorithms, also in reference to their optimization and deployment on architectures with reduced computational capacity. Computer vision techniques for the geometric understanding of spaces, machine learning techniques and practices for the design and implementation of completely connected, convolutive neural architectures, and for the understanding and generation of time sequences are presented. An important part of the course is dedicated to the study of architectures and solutions for the visual understanding of data from cameras positioned inside and outside the passenger compartment - with particular reference to motion estimation, object identification, segmentation semantics the prediction of trajectories, the understanding of the surrounding environment and the monitoring of the driver and his attention state.

      ## Prerequisites
      Basic knowledge of statistics, linear algebra, geometry introduced in the three-year and master's courses of the Engineering degrees. Knowledge of computer architecture and basic knowledge of the Python language (which, however, is taken up again in the course). The Vision and Cognitive Systems course provides useful elements for this course.

      ## Teaching methods
      Most of the lessons are frontal and use scientific slides and papers as didactic support; about 30% of the lessons are laboratory, with hands-on experiences on tensor computation libraries and the design and training of neural networks and AI algorithms for the Automotive. Upon completion, meetings and discussions with companies are organized. Students are required to develop a final project (to be presented during the exam) which requires the study and development of a predictive algorithm applicable in the automotive field, its experimental validation and possibly the collection of data. The presentation of the project must be accompanied by the delivery of the developed code and a technical report describing the approach, its positioning in the literature, the datasets used and the experimental results obtained.

      All lessons will be streamed on Google Meet. The recordings of the lessons will also be available.

      ## Exam
      The exam consists of an oral test, with theoretical questions, presentation of the laboratories developed during the course, and presentation of the final project (see the section "teaching methods").
